    Lucy Goose is Emma Azelborn, Lena Sutter, and Regan Wang.  

    We are friends from college who love making music together. We bring a mix of genre influences to our songs, ranging from folk to classical to punk. We love vocal harmonies and layered guitars.  

    In summer 2021, we went to a cabin for a week to sing together. We left Wisconsin a week later with these tracks written and recorded, which became a beautifully earnest EP.

    Lena Sutter - Vocals, Guitar, Bass, Banjo, Fiddle, Shaker
