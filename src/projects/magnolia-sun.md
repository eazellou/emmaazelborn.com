summary: "An introspective mix of original songs blending folk, jazz, and pop"
description: "During the lonely days of COVID quarantine, I dove into songwriting. What started as an escape turned into a collection of songs that follow the journey from those isolated times through the gradual reopening of the world.
It’s been incredible to see these songs grow far beyond what I imagined. A huge part of that has been the chance to collaborate with the amazing friends and musicians that brought these songs to life in ways I never could have alone."

> In just a few years, Emma Azelborn has become a songwriter to watch in the community singing scene. Her lyricism is at once poetic and direct, thoughtful and deeply sincere. Emma's previous release, Circle Songs, cemented her bonafides as an excellent composer of folk songs, and introduced several songs that I've since heard sung in community on both coasts. However, there is more to Emma's songwriting than circle songs - and on her first full-length release, Magnolia Sun, her versatility and skill is on full display. From the contemplative and haunting "Trees", to the jazzy wistfulness of "A Different Sea", to the unstoppable groove of "Superstar Limo", to the soaring, deeply-rooted harmonies of the "When We Sing Together" album closer, Magnolia Sun weaves deftly between melancholy and joy, carried there and back again by lush arrangements (featuring an all-star cast of backing musicians), well-written poetry, and some great vocal performances. This album is not only a delight to listen to, and not only a snapshot of a talented singer-songwriter coming into their own; it is a soundtrack for finding hope and beauty in the face of adversity.
