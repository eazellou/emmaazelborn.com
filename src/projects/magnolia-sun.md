During the lonely days of COVID quarantine, I dove into songwriting. What started as an escape turned into a collection of songs that follow the journey from those isolated times through the gradual reopening of the world.
Itâ€™s been incredible to see these songs grow far beyond what I imagined. A huge part of that has been the chance to collaborate with the amazing friends and musicians that brought these songs to life in ways I never could have alone.
