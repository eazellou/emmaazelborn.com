intro

- why people like parodies

- downsides of parodies

- rules of thumb

- conclusion




- parody vs setting new words to old melody (if the original is still sung, it's a parody. if it isn't, then it's a new song to an old melody)
- parody to fix a problematic original vs just for parody sake

- parodies are inherently exclusionary because they often rely on a person knowing the original they are parodying for the humor to work. so anyone newer to the scene won't get the jokes and that doesn't feel good.

- a good parody should therefore stand on its own merit as a good song without knowing the original 
- and then at that point, maybe just write an original silly song? lots of folks use the strategy of writing words to an existing melody and then writing a new melody as a songwriting technique...

- parodies of meaningful songs can be really hard to hear when the original has deep emotional ties for the listener. the extreme of this would be like, someone parodying all the salt. which so many of us have so many memories of singing and crying with our friends. but the thing is that most songs with a sweet message have that sort of emotional connection / tie to meaningful history for at least some portion of the group at a given sing. it's about respect for the original song.

- parody needs to be extra easy to sing bc you are fighting against the words people might already know

- never never never ever follow someone singing the original with your parody version of the same song
- small exception if you have a quick verse and the vibe after is playful (don't follow a serious meaningful rendition of the original with a silly bit)

- if someone sings a parody it often opens the door for "parody hour" where everyone jumps in with their favorite parody and ugh. please no. one parody or maybe two is fine but a million parodies in a row gets old fast

- often parodies are just worse than the original. the lyrics might not scan as well or the emphasis of syllables doesn't sit right, the lyrics might be kindof on the nose (the last verse of the itsy bitsy spider one kills me, like come on beat a dead horse some more), etc

- the fun of a parody is usually in the first time you hear it, as a person who knows the original. bc you're like, whoa haha the joke the play on words the inside references I'm catching (see exclusionary bullet above - this doesn't work if you don't already know the original). but once you've heard it that hits less and less and you need the actual song to work or it gets old fast so the songwriting is super important for it not to be annoying
