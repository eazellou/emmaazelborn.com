what will we do if the grass doesn't grow  
crumbling blades becoming sculptures  
sitting among the stones  

how will they know what happened here  
scars stuck forever stretching  
the battleground never grown over the years  

_chorus:_  
nothing stays the same  
nothing stays the same  
we'll rest in the sun and we'll burn away  

what will we say if it stays how it is  
brittle will break and splinter  
shimmer fading and starting to chip  

how could they say that we were wise  
we fought with the ants  
stuck in the sludge of our hopeful lies  

she was brilliance  
starlight searing  
stained by rose and strawberry streaming
