I've been thinking about the way things change  
how nothing stays the same  
and how we try to hold on tight  
but time keeps slipping through our hands  

I've been thinking about the way we love  
how it burns so bright and hot  
and how we think it'll last forever  
but we know it cannot  

we'll burn away  
like stars in the night  
we'll burn away  
but oh, what a light  

I've been thinking about the way we dance  
how we move without a care  
and how we think the music's endless  
but silence fills the air  

we'll burn away  
like stars in the night  
we'll burn away  
but oh, what a light
