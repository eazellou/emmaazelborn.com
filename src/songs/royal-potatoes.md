title: Royal Potatoes
composer: Emma Azelborn

have you heard the latest news that's been going all around?  
there's a forty acre field with potatoes in the ground!  
Parmentier planted them with Louis' royal seal  
but these tons and tons of potatoes are not for you to steal  

_chorus:_  
stay away _(stay away)_ from the royal potatoes!  
we're on guard, _(we're on guard),_ they're not for you _(they're not for you)_  
stay away _(stay away)_ from the royal potatoes  
for potatoes are the fanciest of foods  

now you may want these potatoes that we are guarding here  
but we're of the highest caliber, so let us be clear  
don't ever try to bribe us! by the way, we love our wine  
and we'd never look the other way if you slipped in at night   

now you may think the potato will make you really sick  
after all, it's been illegal since you were just a kid  
but the faculty of medicine announced a big reveal:  
though the leafy greens are toxic, the tubers are a meal!  

there are lots of yummy recipes that you should never try  
you could mash them, or roast them, or chop them into fries  
and potato bread's delicious! but remember this one thing:  
all these tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of potatoes are only for the king
