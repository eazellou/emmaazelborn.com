_chorus:_
if you ever wanna glow, you gotta go ride
if you ever wanna glow, you gotta go ride
superstar limo

scarlet shimmer
street-bright spotlights
join us, we wanna move
filtered faces
outlined in the night
let's break some rules

shivering silk
shock-smooth secret
join us, we are alive
watching wonder
cocoa-sweet sweat
let's rev our rotary drive

if you ever wanna you gotta you gotta
if you ever wanna go go go
