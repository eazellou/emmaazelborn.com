New hands, old strings  
    _Carved in the wood, their names and their phrases_  
New hands, old strings  
    _Passing their notes with bow and pen_  
You help them see  
    _Giving a chance to find where their place is_  
How they can sing  
    _Under the lights they shine again_  
You listen and guide them to who they could be
