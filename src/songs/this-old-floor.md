Today, my friends we stand upon these boards so old and worn
They've served us well but now they're done
We're pulling them up on this crisp autumn morn

_chorus:_
This old floor has held us a hundred years
It's marked by the soles/souls of those who've gathered here

Our footsteps wore at the finish and the bare wood started to show
A faint, familiar oval
From the line of dance where we've traveled the most

Remember the night when Ben dropped the light and it crashed with a thunderous sound?
We swept up the glass, but here is the scratch
A little off center and perfectly round

On contra night you could see that we had a slightly tilted floor
Our sets would drift and our dances left
Diagonal stripes from the stage to the door

We're finding hidden initials left for the generations to see
A heart for newlyweds L and R
Their daughter's granddaughter is here next to me

We're laying down a new floor today, adding marks near those from before
So take a knife, and carve your name
It'll help hold us all for a hundred years more
