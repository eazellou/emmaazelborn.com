you walk down broken tree-lined streets  
piles of bark and branches up to your ears  
your neighbor's roof has fallen in  
no one spared from damage, it's more than you feared  

_chorus:_  
houses can be made, but trees have to grow  
but trees have to grow  
but trees have to grow  

the linden tree in your backyard  
fell in wind and thunder onto your home  
it gave you shade, it held your swing  
it stood for generations, and now it is gone
