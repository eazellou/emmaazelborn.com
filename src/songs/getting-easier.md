it's been getting harder to sing
missing all the people who would sing in harmony
oh remember how our sound
would echo all around
it's been getting harder to sing

it's been getting harder to dance
missing all the people with connection in their hands
oh remember how we spun
and smiled with everyone
it's been getting harder to dance

it's been getting easier to cry
missing all the people, all the people at my side
oh remember it'll end
and hold on until then
it's been getting easier to cry
