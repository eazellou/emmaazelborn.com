title: Hen House Ghost

Everybody gather round 'cause I can't come to you  
No, there's no need to fear  
I'm all cooped up over here  
No matter what I do  

_chorus:_   
I am hen house ghost  
I am hen house ghost  
I can't get away   
So I'm cooking up these eggs   
Maybe someday I'll go home   

I've got my floating frying pan for breakfast in the straw   
Some days I put on a show  
The chickens love my ghostly glow   
Their clucking says it all  

The Evil One's a fan—he recommends my pepper quiche   
Yesterday I made an omelet   
Jalapeño cheddar on it   
Mmmmm he loved the heat  

You gotta try my deviled eggs, I add oregano  
They're over there beside the corn   
They're good enough to die for   
Believe me, I would know
