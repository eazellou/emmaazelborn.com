on every sunday morning I would stand and I would sing  
refrain: I would raise my hand and petition the light  
till I ran right out of breath  
wrapped in His love you raised me  
oh how I tried to believe  

I don't wanna lie to you but would your eyes alight if you knew  
is there something I could do so if I told you it would be true  
if our kindness was a spark we all held beside our heart
