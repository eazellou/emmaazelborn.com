I trusted you and you threw me aside without warning  
You poisoned my ears, my memories are tainted listening  
I'm taking them back, give them back, they aren't yours to tarnish  
those moments so bright, you drove them into darkness  

_chorus:_  
I won't let you poison my memories  
I won't let you poison my memories  

I'm done with hiding away from that pedestal past  
Tired of my memories plagued by that bitter cast  
Those moments are mine, they are mine, they're not yours for the taking  
Golden wires to weave in this web that I'm making
