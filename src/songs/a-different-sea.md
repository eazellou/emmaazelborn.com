I've been thinking of you lately, my friend
of the shape of the curve on the edge of your smile
as you sang us a tale from the end of the bed
I've been thinking of you, my friend

_chorus:_
I've been thinking of you lately
I've been thinking of you lately
but your shore faces a different sea
I've been thinking of you lately
I've been thinking of you lately
but your shore faces a different sea

I've been thinking of you lately my friend
of the brush of our feet on my porch late at night
as we pivoted closely together again
I've been thinking of you my friend

I've been thinking of you lately my friend
and it never compares to the warmth of your arms
oh I miss you so dearly, will this ever end
I've been thinking of you my friend
