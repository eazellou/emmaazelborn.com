title: Dragons of Kilpatrick

we are the glinting gilded girls who heard the calling sea  
her voice it drew us diving to a future swimming free  
we left our lives behind us to embrace the rolling waves  
but may those who aim to pillage know we keep the village safe  
we keep the village safe  

chorus:  
beware! beware! our teeth and claws!  
beware! beware! our fiery jaws!  
our shining scales protect their sails!  
we're the dragons of kilpatrick  

a wicked storm came rushing in when the tide was low  
a stranded crew beyond the rocks had nowhere they could go  
the wind it blew them over, surely every man would drown  
but we picked them up and flew them all the way to solid ground  
all the way to solid ground  

we send out a dragon guard with every trading boat  
to keep a watch for danger and to bring them safely home  
when pirates tried to board them, they were in for a surprise  
a toothy smile, foreboding wings, and bright reptilian eyes  
and bright reptilian eyes  

the raiders of the northern lands attacked our rocky coast  
we rose up from the water to defend it from their blows  
they ignored our roaring bellows when we shook the air with rage  
so we scorched their ships to ashes and they all went down in flames  
they all went down in flames  

we are the glinting gilded girls who heard the calling sea  
and now we are defenders who keep kilpatrick free  
to any who would challenge, may you hear a warning cry:  
if you should try to hurt them, then be prepared to die  
then be prepared to die
