I'm going to grow all the good ones here  
cause I want to know how to greet the sky smiling  
I'm going to grow all the good ones here  
and they'll go and they'll go and they'll go  

_half-chorus:_
I'm in the mood to see something growing  

I'm starting to see little stems appear  
oh how they all reach while their leaves are becoming  
oh what will they be when their blooms are here  
they will go and they'll go and they'll go  

_chorus:_
I'm in the mood to see something growing  
I'm in the mood to see something grow  
I'm in the mood to see something growing  

I'm learning to look at the little things  
the garden is green and the harvest is coming  
I'll plant it again in the coming spring  
and they'll go and they'll go and they'll go
