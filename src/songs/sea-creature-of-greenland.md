Oh the year was 1734  
When disciples set sail on the word of their lord  
The lookout exclaimed as they crossed Baffin Bay  
There was something emerging from within the waves  

_chorus:_
It was a most unusual sight  
Wondrous and wiggling and wrinkled and white  
Its head as high as the ship  
Its tail behind so long and thick  
The sea creature of Greenland  
Most dreadful and monstrously big  

Oh it truly was a magnificent beast  
So curving and floppy, a king of the sea  
It rose up above the ship's yard arm  
And excitedly waved to the sea men's alarm  

Every port, the sailors would spread the word  
A serpent of gobsmacking, glorious girth  
With every retelling it doubled in scale  
And then old Willie whaler caught wind of the tale  

Old Willie he knew what the whales would do  
When they'd see a whale they wanted to woo  
They'd float on their backs, put it all on display  
Oh yes, inviting that whale to play
