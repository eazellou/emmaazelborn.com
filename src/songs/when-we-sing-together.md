my friends we have traveled far to gather here today
the light is dim, the shadows long our time is slipping away
our voices blend so easily just like they always do
as we join again in joyful song and let it bring us through

_chorus:_
when we sing together it's like we were never alone
we want to forever believe our music will ring where green things grow
we know it'll fade so we sing ever stronger, fill up our hearts with home
when we sing together it's like we were never alone

the air, how it shimmers as we sing in harmony
and we can feel the floorboards shaking underneath our feet
we lean against each other and pretend it'll never end
for we've built this song together and we'll sing it once again

no matter how much we try this moment cannot stay
our songs will turn to silence and we'll go our separate ways
the heartache it will have us as it ever has before
cause we cannot know where we will go or when we'll meet once more

and now when we're in the world, the little things we see
can bring to mind our times gone by, the ghosts of harmony
the rumbling train, the evening light, a warm cup of tea held near
we all carry with us memories like those we're making here
