You've been afraid for far too long
So hidden away
So scared of a change and what could go wrong

_chorus:_
Toss the bones high
Be steady and small
And dance while they spin in the sky
They'll fall where they fall

The truth will grow so hard to hide
And every time
You build on the lies will eat you alive

Your stem could be cut, your leaves could wilt
Discarded aside
So suddenly dry yet drowning in guilt

But roots could expand so solid and deep
Your branches could grow
Supported by those whose hearts you keep

Whatever may come your strength will hold
Stop hiding away
You're ready for change, go out and be bold
