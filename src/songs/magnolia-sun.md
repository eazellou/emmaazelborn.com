I miss her  
she was so in love with you  
sure that all your words were true  
dreaming of magnolia sun  

I miss her  
her life was so entwined with yours  
your cardigan she always wore  
now her days are done  

_half-chorus:_  
a part of me will always be in love with what I saw in you  
we're not each other's people anymore  
but a part of me will always be in love with who I was with you  

I miss her  
she could make you laugh for hours  
singing songs of absent flowers  
huddled in your coat in the cold  

I miss her  
she'd never needed to rebuild  
no mended seams to slowly gild  
unafraid and bold  

_chorus:_  
a part of me will always be in love with what I saw in you  
we're not each other's people anymore  
but a part of me will always be in love with who I was with you  
we're not each other's people anymore  

she was more than her divining  
her magnolia sun still shining  
she was more than her divining  
her magnolia sun still shining  

we're not each others people anymore
