I miss her  
she was so in love with you  
sure that all your words were true  
dreaming of magnolia sun  

I miss her  
her laughter filled the room  
she believed in every bloom  
dreaming of magnolia sun  

but now she's gone  
and you're left alone  
with memories of what you had  
and dreams of what you'll never know  

I miss her  
she was so in love with you  
sure that all your words were true  
dreaming of magnolia sun
