Late at night we've got the munchies
No, no, not the munchies
We could go for something crunchy
We don't want the munchies

_chorus:_
We know what we are wanting
Midnight, midnight pizza
We know what we are wanting
Midnight, midnight pizza

That grilled cheese smells so delicious
No, no, not the grilled cheese
Crispy with a melty finish
We don't want the grilled cheese

We could stop and get some tacos
No, no, not the tacos
I hear they make cheesy nachos
We don't want the tacos

Those burritos are so wide
No, no, not burritos
meat and cheese and veg inside
We don't want burritos

We could order spicy wontons
No, no, not the wontons
eat em up until they're all gone
We don't want the wontons

How about some gourmet waffles
No, no, not the waffles
with real syrup, fake is awful
We don't want the waffles
