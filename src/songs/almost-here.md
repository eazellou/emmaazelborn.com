you sang a song to me when I cried on the phone  
you sang a song to me when I felt so alone  
I heard as you sang from a thousand miles away  
you sang a song to me  

you danced around with me and we whirled across the room  
you danced around with me and we made up every move  
your laugh as we spun, I hear it still the night is gone  
you danced around with me  

I love to call with you when we have nothing to say  
I love to call with you when we leave it on all day  
your voice in my ear, it is almost like you're here  
I love to call with you  

you sang a song to me when I cried on the phone  
you sang a song to me when I felt so alone  
I heard as you played from a thousand miles away  
you sang a song  
you sang a song  
you sang a song to me
