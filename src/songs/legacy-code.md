We've got a problem
We've gotta go
We thought we could fix it in a day
Down, down, down
Our tools weren't made to do this
We've gotta go
Our ancient patterns are hard to change
Down, down, down

_chorus:_
We've gotta go down, down, down
Down in the depths where nobody goes
And what we will find there nobody knows
We've gotta go down, down
In our legacy, legacy code

There's no documentation
We've gotta go
And those who wrote it are no longer here
Down, down, down
The smallest change could break it
We've gotta go
Cause so much was made with it over the years
Down, down, down

Oh the horrors we'll uncover
We've gotta go
And oh the terrors we will see
Down, down, down
Why would someone write this
We've gotta go
I looked in the records -gasp- written by me
Down, down, down

It was built with good intentions
We've gotta go
Constraints and assumptions no longer true
Down, down, down
We might think that we are different
We've gotta go
Tomorrow our code will be legacy too
Down, down, down
